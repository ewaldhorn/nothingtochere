# Nothing to C here
For real.

## But what can you C here

Just me refreshing my C knowledge. Turns out porting code from C to Go goes a lot better when you can actually read and understand the original language. Also, C is still a pretty handy language, it's a good skill to keep fresh! There's also the fact that a lot of native Android apps use C or C++ for interacting with bespoke hardware... And debugging these apps go better when you can read the code!

### Progress
- The C Programming language
  (I'm working through this one, it's a borrowed copy, so I can't keep it forever!)
