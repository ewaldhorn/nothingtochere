# Nothing to C here

For real.

## But what can you C here

Just me refreshing my C knowledge. Turns out porting code from C to Go goes a lot better when you can actually read and understand the original language. Also, C is still a pretty handy language, it's a good skill to keep fresh! There's also the fact that a lot of native Android apps use C or C++ for interacting with bespoke hardware... And debugging these apps go better when you can read the code!

## CAUTION

These are _experiments_, so please don't just blindly run any of this code on your computer. Some if it could be meant to recreate a bug or some unexpected behaviour. I try to document that when I add something like that to a public repo, but, alas, something could slip through. Take care. Better yet, use someone else computer!

### Oi! You lied! I see C++ and other stuff here!

Yes, you do. Deal with it.
