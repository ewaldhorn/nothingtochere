# Assortment of C shorts

Basically quick experiments to get something working that I need for a larger project.

## Running C with Zig

Use `zig run <source>` to run a file without needing to build it first.

## Building C with Zig

Use `zig cc <source> -o <target>` to build C files. Optionally, ommit the `-o <target>` part to get a generic `a.out` binary file.
